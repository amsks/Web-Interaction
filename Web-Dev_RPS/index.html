The other months are full of humid heat that is common to these areas of South India. </p>

                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        My association with Manipal has been for about four years. It is the place where I pursued my Bachelor's degree in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering. My father is in a job that requires a high degree of mobility, and so I never spend more than 2-3 years in one single place during my school life. Thus, even though I was born in the capital of India, New Delhi, I never spent much time there. Thus, Manipal closest to a Hometown to me, both in terms of the time spent and the impact it has had on me. This impact was not just limited to studies, but also to the places I used to visit, the friends I made during those four years, the people I met and learned hundreds of things from, etc. It has imbibed in me a desire to travel different places around the world and expand my experience of those places by not
                        just seeing the things that everyone tells you to see, but also see it through the lens of someone living there, by making new friends. Manipal has been central in my ability to -connect with people, learn new things, and become a better leader.
